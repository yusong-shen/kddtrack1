Project Page: http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/apex_wiki/kddtrack1

--- Required Files ---
Put all the required files in current folder( same folder as README )
(1) KDDCup track1 files: http://kddcup.yahoo.com/datasets.php, 
    * track1test.txt 
    * trainIdx1.txt
    * validationIdx1.txt
    * trackData1.txt
    * albumData1.txt
--- System Requirements ---
* linux, g++, makefile, python (may work in other posix system)
* SVDFeature Toolkit
* 50GB hard-disk(approximate estimation, maybe a bit over estimate)
* 2GB memory( or more if we need more latent factors )

--- Major Scripts and Folders ---
* prepare_experiment.sh : prepare the experiment enviroment
* Makefile : specifies the feature generation rules
* cpp   : c++ codes for feature generation
* python: python codes for feature generation
* run   : experiment scripts for other settings

--- Getting Started ---
(1) Download SVDFeature, get the required files in current folder 
(2) set the path to SVDFeature in 3rd line of prepare_experiment.sh(very important)
    i.e:  SVDFEATURE=/path/to/svd-feature
(3) run prepare_experiment.sh
(4) execute run.sh in "run" folder for different experiment settings

--- Experiment Explanation ---
(1) We use binary "user grouped format" as input for SVDFeature(details in manual)
(2) We generate different kinds of features seperately in the folder "features"
(3) "utils/kddcup_combine_ugroup" combines different kinds of feature files together into a binary file format accepted by SVDFeature
     This program can be used to generate different compositions of features available in folder "features"
(4) All the feature generation rules are written in Makefile, please refer to it for generation details
(5) This experiment is created for demo purpose, the parameters are not fine tuned, we include the most effective components we used during competition

--- Scripts ---
See the scripts in folder "run", these are scripts for other feature settings
